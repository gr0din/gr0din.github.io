<h2>Want to Play Morrowind in Linux? Try OpenMW</h2> 
<p>If you are a linux user with a penchant for playing older/classic games, you may have thought about firing up the Bethesda classic, Morrowind. Obviously running any windows applications in Linux comes with a certain set of restraints. Using compatibility layers such as wine has been a staple in making these sorts of things work, but in this case there is a slightly different if not easier method of getting Morrowind running under the linux operating system.</p> 
<p>Enter OpenMW a project aimed at recreating the Morrowind engine using more modern techniques. It supports running at higher resolutions, implements various bugfixes, and even has a fork that implements multiplayer. That alone should be enough to excite any long time Morrowind fan, but for linux users it gets even better. OpenMW fully supports linux operating systems for building the engine against, which means you can once again enter the bizarre, yet interesting world of Morrowind on your linux box.</p>
