<h2>Why Loot Boxes Are Destroying Gaming</h2> 
<p>Loot boxes have been the bane of many gamers existences lately with these pseudo-gambling gaming devices being added to more and more games. They have gone so far as to raise the attention of the FTC (Federal Trade Commission), which is definitely rattling some cages. Companies such as EA, Ubisoft, and Bethesda have come under attack recently for adding loot boxes to their flagship games.</p> 
<p>So why does any of this matter? Can't you just choose *not* to partake in loot boxes if you don't agree with them? Well yes that is one option you can take, but the problem lies not with loot boxes being optional, it's that they completely change a games economy. Instead of grinding slowly through game progression to reach a goal, be it armor, a weapon, or even just aesthetics, doing so through a loot box gives you a paid chance at achieving those same goals, but with a real world cost.</p> 
<p>Loot boxes stem from the new movement to take games away from their classic formula, and create a "game as a service". Instead of making a standard single or multiplayer experience with a one time purchase, games as a service certainly look lucrative to investors funding multimillion dollar triple A titles. Not only can games self for full purchase price, they can also charge for impulse gambles on chances for in-game items. I don't use gamble here lightly either because if you are using real money for a chance at receiving some kind asset of value, be it real life or digital, it is gambling.</p> 
<p>Loot boxes should also receive a proper distinction from traditional microtransactions and DLC that games provide as well. At the very least with a microtransaction or DLC purchase, you get exactly what you pay far. With a loot box you simply are receiving a chance for similar digital assets. It is that chance that can make loot boxes so addictive and why they are predatory in nature. This has been a problem that has plagued mobile games as well. Overall most players may never buy a microtransaction at all, or if they do, it may be on the lower end of the scale. It is the whales or the big spenders that truly move the needle when it comes to the profits seen with these games. For those struggling with gambling addiction this can create a cycle in which they may start out as a small spender, slowly doing more until they become a full fledged whale.</p>
